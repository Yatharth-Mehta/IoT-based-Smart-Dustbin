**_Smart IoT Dustbin_**

**Overview :**
This Smart IoT Dustbin is an intelligent waste management system designed to enhance hygiene and efficiency using ultrasonic and soil moisture sensors. By leveraging Arduino and servo motor automation, this system enables hands-free operation while incorporating moisture detection to differentiate between dry and wet waste.

**Features :** 
1) Automatic Lid Mechanism: Opens the dustbin when an object is detected within a specified range using an ultrasonic sensor.
2) Smart Waste Classification: Uses a moisture sensor to determine if the waste is wet or dry, enabling optimized waste segregation.
3) Energy Efficient: The system is designed to operate only when necessary, minimizing power consumption.
4) Compact and Scalable: Can be adapted for smart homes, offices, and public waste bins, contributing to a cleaner environment.

**Technical Implementation :**
1) Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Detects proximity and triggers the servo motor to open the lid.
2) Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures moisture levels in the waste to classify it as wet or dry.
3) Servo Motor: Controls the dustbin lid, ensuring smooth and automated operation.
4) Arduino-based Control: Implements real-time sensor readings and actuation logic for seamless operation.

**Future Enhancements :**
Integration with IoT cloud platforms for remote monitoring and data analytics.
Addition of smart notifications for waste disposal status.
Solar-powered energy source for enhanced sustainability.

**Why This Project?**
This project is a practical implementation of IoT in waste management, offering a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable solution. It demonstrates sensor integration, automation, and real-time decision-making, making it an excellent showcase of embedded systems and smart technology.
