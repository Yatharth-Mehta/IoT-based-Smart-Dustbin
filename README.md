## 🛠️ Technical Implementation  
### **🔧 Hardware Components**  
- 🎯 **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Detects proximity to open the lid automatically.  
- 🌱 **Moisture Sensor:** Determines if the waste is **wet or dry** for segregation.  
- 🔧 **Servo Motor:** Controls the bin lid for **smooth and automated operation**.  
- 🖥️ **Arduino-Based Control:** Processes sensor data and executes real-time automation.  

### **🖥️ Software Architecture**  
- **📏 Sensor Data Collection:**  
  - Ultrasonic sensor measures distance to detect approaching waste.  
  - Moisture sensor analyzes the waste to classify it.  
- **⚡ Automated Actuation:**  
  - If waste is detected, the **servo motor opens the bin lid**.  
  - Based on moisture content, it determines whether waste is **wet or dry**.  
- **🔄 Smart Control Mechanism:**  
  - Wet waste → **Lid opens longer** for proper disposal.  
  - Dry waste → **Lid closes quickly** to prevent contamination.
